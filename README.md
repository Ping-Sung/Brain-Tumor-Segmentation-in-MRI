# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-in-MRI
Final project at National Chung-Hsing Univ. Developed an automated system using U-Net to accurately detect/segment brain tumors from MRI images, saving time and improving diagnosis. Model achieved dice loss of 0.08 during training, indicating accurate segmentation. Further evaluation needed.
